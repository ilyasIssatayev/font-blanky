# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a web-based 3D sphere editor using p5.js with a modern, Figma-inspired interface. The editor will allow users to create, manipulate, and customize 3D spheres in real-time with an intuitive visual interface that includes property panels, toolbars, and a canvas workspace.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a creative developer, I want to create and manipulate 3D spheres in a visual editor, so that I can prototype and experiment with 3D graphics without writing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a canvas area with a default 3D sphere
2. WHEN a user interacts with the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow rotation and zoom of the 3D view
3. WHEN a user modifies sphere properties THEN the system SHALL update the 3D sphere in real-time
4. IF the canvas is empty THEN the system SHALL add a new sphere

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a Figma-like interface layout, so that I can work efficiently with familiar design tool patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left sidebar
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display in a left bar vertical list of input fields, each field should change pec of sphere like radius, rotation speed, gradient of colors (color picker) and etc.
2. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a top toolbar with common actions like pause of sphere rotation, rerender of sphere, wipe all specs and go to default values
3. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a central canvas area for 3D rendering
4. WHEN a user resizes panels THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout proportions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize sphere properties through visual controls, so that I can see immediate feedback of my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sphere is selected THEN the system SHALL display editable properties in the right panel
2. WHEN a user changes sphere radius THEN the system SHALL update the sphere size immediately
3. WHEN a user changes sphere color THEN the system SHALL update the sphere appearance immediately
4. WHEN a user changes sphere position THEN the system SHALL move the sphere in 3D space
5. WHEN a user changes material properties THEN the system SHALL update lighting and surface appearance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want interactive 3D controls, so that I can navigate and manipulate objects intuitively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags on the canvas THEN the system SHALL rotate the camera around the sphere
2. WHEN a user scrolls on the canvas THEN the system SHALL zoom in or out
3. WHEN a user clicks on a sphere THEN the system SHALL select that sphere
4. WHEN a sphere is selected THEN the system SHALL display visual selection indicators
5. WHEN a user drags a selected sphere THEN the system SHALL move it in 3D space

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple spheres and layers, so that I can create complex 3D scenes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a new sphere THEN the system SHALL create it at the scene center
2. WHEN multiple spheres exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a layers panel
3. WHEN a user clicks on a layer THEN the system SHALL select the corresponding sphere
4. WHEN a user toggles layer visibility THEN the system SHALL show or hide the sphere
5. WHEN a user deletes a layer THEN the system SHALL remove the sphere from the scene

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my 3D scene, so that I can use it in other projects or share my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks export THEN the system SHALL provide options for different formats
2. WHEN a user exports as image THEN the system SHALL capture the current 3D view
3. WHEN a user exports as code THEN the system SHALL generate p5.js code for the scene
4. WHEN a user saves the project THEN the system SHALL store the scene configuration locally

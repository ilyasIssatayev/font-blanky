const plague =  `The unusual events described in this chronicle occurred in 194- at Oran. Everyone agreed
that, considering their somewhat extraordinary character, they were out of place there.
For its ordinariness is what strikes one first about the town of Oran, which is merely a
large French port on the Algerian coast, headquarters of the Prefect of a French
Department.
 The town itself, let us admit, is ugly. It has a smug, placid air and you need time
to discover what it is that makes it different from so many business centers in other parts
of the world. How to conjure up a picture, for instance, of a town without pigeons,
without any trees or gardens, where you never hear the beat of wings or the rustle of
leaves, a thoroughly negative place, in short?
 The seasons are discriminated only in the sky. All that tells you of spring's
coming is the feel of the air, or the baskets of flowers brought in from the suburbs by
peddlers; it's a spring cried in the marketplaces. During the summer the sun bakes the
houses bone-dry, sprinkles our walls with grayish dust, and you have no option but to
survive those days of fire indoors, behind closed shutters. In autumn, on the other hand,
we have deluges of mud. Only winter brings really pleasant weather.
 Perhaps the easiest way of making a town's acquaintance is to ascertain how the
people in it work, how they love, and how they die. In our little town (is this, one
wonders, an effect of the climate? All three are done on much the same lines, with the
same feverish yet casual air. The truth is that everyone is bored, and devotes himself to 
cultivating habits. Our citizens work hard, but solely with the object of getting rich. Their
chief interest is in commerce, and their chief aim in life is, as they call it, "doing
business." Naturally they don't eschew such simpler pleasures as love-making,
seabathing, going to the pictures. But, very sensibly, they reserve these pastimes for
Saturday afternoons and Sundays and employ the rest of the week in making money, as
much as possible. In the evening, on leaving the office, they forgather, at an hour that
never varies, in the cafes, stroll the same boulevard, or take the air on their balconies. The
passions of the young are violent and short-lived; the vices of older men seldom range
beyond an addiction to bowling, to banquets and "socials," or clubs where large sums
change hands on the fall of a card. 

It will be said, no doubt, that these habits are not peculiar to our town; really all
our contemporaries are much the same. Certainly nothing is commoner nowadays than to
see people working from morn till night and then proceeding to fritter away at cardtables, in cafes and in small-talk what time is left for living. Nevertheless there still exist
towns and countries where people have now and then an inkling of something different.
In general it doesn't change their lives. Still, they have had an intimation, and that's so
much to the good. Oran, however, seems to be a town without intimations; in other
words, completely modern. Hence I see no need to dwell on the manner of loving in our
town. The men and women consume one another rapidly in what is called "the act of
love," or else settle down to a mild habit of conjugality. We seldom find a mean between
these extremes. That, too, is not exceptional. At Oran, as elsewhere, for lack of time and
thinking, people have to love one another without knowing much about it.
 What is more exceptional in our town is the difficulty one may experience there in
dying. "Difficulty," perhaps, is not the right word, 'discomfort" would come nearer. Being
ill's never agreeable but there are towns that stand by you, so to speak, when you are sick;
in which you can, after a fashion, let yourself go.
 An invalid needs small attentions, he likes to have something to rely on, and that's
natural enough. But at Oran the violent extremes of temperature, the exigencies of
business, the uninspiring surroundings, the sudden nightfalls, and the very nature of its
pleasures call for good health. An invalid feels out of it there.
 Think what it must be for a dying man, trapped behind hundreds of walls all
sizzling with heat, while the whole population, sitting in cafes or hanging on the
telephone, is discussing shipments, bills of lading, discounts! It will then be obvious what
discomfort attends death, even modern death, when it waylays you under such conditions
in a dry place.
 These somewhat haphazard observations may give a fair idea of what our town is
like. However, we must not exaggerate. Really, all that was to be conveyed was the
banality of the town's appearance and of life in it. But you can get through the days there
without trouble, once you have formed habits. And since habits are precisely what our
town encourages, all is for the best. Viewed from this angle, its life is not particularly
exciting; that must be admitted. But, at least, social unrest is quite unknown among us.
And our frank-spoken, amiable, and industrious citizens have always inspired a
reasonable esteem in visitors. 

Treeless, glamourless, soulless, the town of Oran ends by seeming restful and,
after a while, you go complacently to sleep there. 
 It is only fair to add that Oran is grafted on to a unique landscape, in the center of
a bare plateau, ringed with luminous hills and above a perfectly shaped bay. All we may
regret is the town's being so disposed that it turns its back on the bay, with the result that
it's impossible to see the sea, you always have to go to look for it.
 Such being the normal life of Oran, it will be easily understood that our fellow
citizens had not the faintest reason to apprehend the incidents that took place in the spring
of the year in question and were (as we subsequently realized) premonitory signs of the
grave events we are to chronicle. To some, these events will seem quite natural; to others,
all but incredible. But, obviously, a narrator cannot take account of these differences of
outlook. His business is only to say: "This is what happened," when he knows that it
actually did happen, that it closely affected the life of a whole populace, and that there are
thousands of eyewitnesses who can appraise in their hearts the truth of what he writes.
 In any case the narrator (whose identity will be made known in due course) would
have little claim to competence for a task like this, had not chance put him in the way of
gathering much information, and had he not been, by the force of things, closely involved
in all that he proposes to narrate. This is his justification for playing the part of a
historian. Naturally, a historian, even an amateur, always has data, personal or at second
hand, to guide him. The present narrator has three kinds of data: first, what he saw
himself; secondly, the accounts of other eyewitnesses (thanks to the part he played, he
was enabled to learn their personal impressions from all those figuring in this chronicle);
and, lastly, documents that subsequently came into his hands. He proposes to draw on
these records whenever this seems desirable, and to employ them as he thinks best. He
also proposes...
 But perhaps the time has come to drop preliminaries and cautionary remarks and
to launch into the narrative proper. The account of the first days needs giving in some
detail. 
When leaving his surgery on the morning of April 16, Dr. Bernard Rieux felt
something soft under his foot. It was a dead rat lying in the middle of the landing.
 On the spur of the moment he kicked it to one side and, without giving it a further
thought, continued on his way downstairs. Only when he was stepping out into the street
did it occur to him that a dead rat had no business to be on his landing, and he turned
back to ask the concierge of the building to see to its removal. It was not until he noticed
old M. Michel's reaction to the news that he realized the peculiar nature of his discovery.
Personally, he had thought the presence of the dead rat rather odd, no more than that; the
concierge, however, was genuinely outraged. On one point he was categorical: "There
weren't no rats here." In vain the doctor assured him that there was a rat, presumably
dead, on the second-floor landing; M. Michel's conviction wasn't to be shaken. There
"weren't no rats in the building," he repeated, so someone must have brought this one
from outside. Some youngster trying to be funny, most likely.
 That evening, when Dr. Rieux was standing in the entrance, feeling for the latchkey in his pocket before starting up the stairs to his apartment, he saw a big rat coming
toward him from the dark end of the passage. It moved uncertainly, and its fur was
sopping wet. The animal stopped and seemed to be trying to get its balance, moved
forward again toward the doctor, halted again, then spun round on itself with a little
squeal and fell on its side. Its mouth was slightly open and blood was spurting from it.
After gazing at it for a moment, the doctor went upstairs. 
 He wasn't thinking about the rat. That glimpse of spurting blood had switched his
thoughts back to something that had been on his mind all day. His wife, who had been ill
for a year now, was due to leave next day for a sanatorium in the mountains. He found
her lying down in the bedroom, resting, as he had asked her to do, in view of the
exhausting journey before her. She gave him a smile.
 "Do you know, I'm feeling ever so much better!" she said.
 The doctor gazed down at the face that turned toward him in the glow of the
bedside lamp. His wife was thirty, and the long illness had left its mark on her face. Yet
the thought that came to Rieux's mind as he gazed at her was: "How young she looks,
almost like a little girl!" But perhaps that was because of the smile, which effaced all
else. 

"Now try to sleep," he counseled. "The nurse is coming at eleven, you know, and
you have to catch the midday train."
 He kissed the slightly moist forehead. The smile escorted him to the door.
 Next day, April 17, at eight o'clock the concierge buttonholed the doctor as he
was going out. Some young scallywags, he said, had dumped three dead rats in the hall.
They'd obviously been caught in traps with very strong springs, as they were bleeding
profusely. The concierge had lingered in the doorway for quite a while, holding the rats
by their legs and keeping a sharp eye on the passers-by, on the off chance that the
miscreants would give themselves away by grinning or by some facetious remark. His
watch had been in vain.
 "But I'll nab 'em all right," said M. Michel hopefully.
 Much puzzled, Rieux decided to begin his round in the outskirts of the town,
where his poorer patients lived. The scavenging in these districts was done late in the
morning and, as he drove his car along the straight, dusty streets, he cast glances at the
garbage cans aligned along the edge of the sidewalk. In one street alone the doctor
counted as many as a dozen rats deposited on the vegetable and other refuse in the cans.
 He found his first patient, an asthma case of long standing, in bed, in a room that
served as both dining-room and bedroom and overlooked the street. The invalid was an
old Spaniard with a hard, rugged face. Placed on the coverlet in front of him were two
pots containing dried peas. When the doctor entered, the old man was sitting up, bending
his neck back, gasping and wheezing in his efforts to recover his breath. His wife brought
a bowl of water.
 "Well, doctor," he said, while the injection was being made, "they're coming out,
have you noticed?"
 "The rats, he means," his wife explained. "The man next door found three."
 "They're coming out, you can see them in all the trash cans. It's hunger!"
 Rieux soon discovered that the rats were the great topic of conversation in that
part of the town. After his round of visits he drove home.
 "There's a telegram for you, sir, upstairs," M. Michel informed him.
 The doctor asked him if he'd seen any more rats.
 "No," the concierge replied, "there ain't been any more. I'm keeping a sharp
lookout, you know. Those youngsters wouldn't dare when I'm around."
 The telegram informed Rieux that his mother would be arriving next day. She was
going to keep house for her son during his wife's absence. When the doctor entered his
apartment he found the nurse already there. He looked at his wife. 

She was in a tailor-made suit, and he noticed that she had used rouge. He smiled
to her.
 "That's splendid," he said. "You're looking very nice."
 A few minutes later he was seeing her into the sleeping-car. She glanced round
the compartment.
 "It's too expensive for us really, isn't it?"
 "It had to be done," Rieux replied.
 "What's this story about rats that's going round?"
 "I can't explain it. It certainly is queer, but it'll pass."
 Then hurriedly he begged her to forgive him; he felt he should have looked after
her better, he'd been most remiss. When she shook her head, as if to make him stop, he
added: "Anyhow, once you're back everything will be better. We'll make a fresh start."
 "That's it!" Her eyes were sparkling. "Let's make a fresh start."
 But then she turned her head and seemed to be gazing through the car window at
the people on the platform, jostling one another in their haste. The hissing of the
locomotive reached their ears. Gently he called his wife's first name; when she looked
round he saw her face wet with tears.
 "Don't," he murmured.
 Behind the tears the smile returned, a little tense. She drew a deep breath.
 "Now off you go! Everything will be all right."
 He took her in his arms, then stepped back on the platform. Now he could only
see her smile through the window.
 "Please, dear," he said, "take great care of yourself."
 But she could not hear him.
 As he was leaving the platform, near the exit he met M. Othon, the police
magistrate, holding his small boy by the hand. The doctor asked him if he was going
away.
 Tall and dark, M. Othon had something of the air of what used to be called a man
of the world, and something of an undertaker's assistant.
 "No," the magistrate replied, "I've come to meet Madame Othon, who's been to
present her respects to my family."
 The engine whistled.
 "These rats, now?" the magistrate began.
 Rieux made a brief movement in the direction of the train, then turned back
toward the exit.
 "The rats?" he said. "It's nothing."
 The only impression of that moment which, afterwards, he could recall was the
passing of a railroadman with a box full of dead rats under his arm.
 Early in the afternoon of that day, when his consultations were beginning, a
young man called on Rieux. The doctor gathered that he had called before, in the
morning, and was a journalist by profession. His name was Raymond Rambert.
 Short, square-shouldered, with a determined-looking face and keen, intelligent
eyes, he gave the impression of someone who could keep his end up in any
circumstances. He wore a sports type of clothes. He came straight to the point.
His newspaper, one of the leading Paris dailies, had commissioned him to make a
report on the living-conditions prevailing among the Arab population, and especially on
the sanitary conditions.
 Rieux replied that these conditions were not good. But, before he said any more,
he wanted to know if the journalist would be allowed to tell the truth.
 "Certainly," Rambert replied.
 "I mean," Rieux explained, "would you be allowed to publish an unqualified
condemnation of the present state of things?"
 "Unqualified? Well, no, I couldn't go that far. But surely things aren't quite so bad
as that?"
 "No," Rieux said quietly, they weren't so bad as that. He had put the question
solely to find out if Rambert could or couldn't state the facts without paltering with the
truth. "I've no use for statements in which something is kept back," he added. "That is
why I shall not furnish information in support of yours."
 The journalist smiled. "You talk the language of Saint-Just."
 Without raising his voice Rieux said he knew nothing about that. The language he
used was that of a man who was sick and tired of the world he lived in, though he had
much liking for his fellow men and had resolved, for his part, to have no truck with
injustice and compromises with the truth.
 His shoulders hunched, Rambert gazed at the doctor for some moments without
speaking. Then, "I think I understand you," he said, getting up from his chair.
 The doctor accompanied him to the door.
 "It's good of you to take it like that," he said.
 "Yes, yes, I understand," Rambert repeated, with what seemed a hint of
impatience in his voice. "Sorry to have troubled you."
 When shaking hands with him, Rieux suggested that if he was out for curious
stories for his paper, he might say something about the extraordinary number of dead rats
that were being found in the town just now.
 "Ah!" Rambert exclaimed. "That certainly interests me."
 On his way out at five for another round of visits, the doctor passed on the
stairway a stocky, youngish man, with a big, deeply furrowed face and bushy eyebrows.
He had met him once or twice in the top-floor apartment, which was occupied by some
male Spanish dancers. Puffing a cigarette, Jean Tarrou was gazing down at the
convulsions of a rat dying on the step in front of him. He looked up, and his gray eyes
remained fixed on the doctor for some moments; then, after wishing him good day, he
remarked that it was rather odd, the way all these rats were coming out of their holes to
die.
 "Very odd," Rieux agreed, "and it ends by getting on one's nerves."
 "In a way, doctor, only in a way. We've not seen anything of the sort before, that's
all. Personally I find it interesting, yes, definitely interesting."
 Tarrou ran his fingers through his hair to brush it off his forehead, looked again at
the rat, which had now stopped moving, then smiled toward Rieux.
 "But really, doctor, it's the concierge's headache, isn't it?"
 As it so happened, the concierge was the next person Rieux encountered. He was
leaning against the wall beside the street door; he was looking tired and his normally
rubicund face had lost its color

"Yes, I know," the old man told Rieux, who had informed him of the latest
casualty among the rats. "I keep finding 'em by twos and threes. But it's the same thing in
the other houses in the street."
 He seemed depressed and worried, and was scratching his neck absentmindedly.
 Rieux asked him how he felt. The concierge wouldn't go so far as to say he was
feeling ill. Still he wasn't quite up to the mark. In his opinion it was just due to worry;
these damned rats had given him "a shock, like." It would be a relief when they stopped
coming out and dying all over the place.
 Next morning, it was April 18, when the doctor was bringing back his mother
from the station, he found M. Michel looking still more out of sorts. The stairway from
the cellar to the attics was strewn with dead rats, ten or a dozen of them.
 The garbage cans of all the houses in the street were full of rats.
 The doctor's mother took it quite calmly.
 "It's like that sometimes," she said vaguely. She was a small woman with silver
hair and dark, gentle eyes. "I'm so glad to be with you again, Bernard," she added. "The
rats can't change that, anyhow."
 He nodded. It was a fact that everything seemed easy when she was there.
 However, he rang up the Municipal Office. He knew the man in charge of the
department concerned with the extermination of vermin and he asked him if he'd heard
about all the rats that were coming out to die in the open. Yes, Mercier knew all about it;
in fact, fifty rats had been found in his offices, which were near the wharves. To tell the
truth, he was rather perturbed; did the doctor think it meant anything serious? Rieux
couldn't give a definite opinion, but he thought the sanitary service should take action of
some kind.
 Mercier agreed. "And, if you think it's really worth the trouble, I'll get an order
issued as well."
 "It certainly is worth the trouble," Rieux replied.
 His charwoman had just told him that several hundred dead rats had been
collected in the big factory where her husband worked.
 It was about this time that our townsfolk began to show signs of uneasiness.
 For, from April 18 onwards, quantities of dead or dying rats were found in
factories and warehouses. In some cases the animals were killed to put an end to their
agony. From the outer suburbs to the center of the town, in all the byways where the
doctor's duties took him, in every thoroughfare, rats were piled up in garbage cans or
lying in long lines in the gutters. The evening papers that day took up the matter and
inquired whether or not the city fathers were going to take steps, and what emergency
measures were contemplated, to abate this particularly disgusting nuisance. Actually the
municipality had not contemplated doing anything at all, but now a meeting was
convened to discuss the situation.
 An order was transmitted to the sanitary service to collect the dead rats at
daybreak every morning. When the rats had been collected, two municipal trucks were to
take them to be burned in the town incinerator.
 But the situation worsened in the following days. There were more and more dead
vermin in the streets, and the collectors had bigger truckloads every morning. `

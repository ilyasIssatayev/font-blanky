const plague =  `The unusual events described in this chronicle occurred in 194- at Oran. Everyone agreed
that, considering their somewhat extraordinary character, they were out of place there.
For its ordinariness is what strikes one first about the town of Oran, which is merely a
large French port on the Algerian coast, headquarters of the Prefect of a French
Department.
 The town itself, let us admit, is ugly. It has a smug, placid air and you need time
to discover what it is that makes it different from so many business centers in other parts
of the world. How to conjure up a picture, for instance, of a town without pigeons,
without any trees or gardens, where you never hear the beat of wings or the rustle of
leaves, a thoroughly negative place, in short?
 The seasons are discriminated only in the sky. All that tells you of spring's
coming is the feel of the air, or the baskets of flowers brought in from the suburbs by
peddlers; it's a spring cried in the marketplaces. During the summer the sun bakes the
houses bone-dry, sprinkles our walls with grayish dust, and you have no option but to
survive those days of fire indoors, behind closed shutters. In autumn, on the other hand,
we have deluges of mud. Only winter brings really pleasant weather. `
